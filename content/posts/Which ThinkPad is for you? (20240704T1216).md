Well well well, you probably have clicked on this article beause you got interested in ThinkPads, and now you want to join the <s>cult</s>Community. But where does one start?

## Your overall choices

Firstly, one must consier what you want the ThinkPad for and what you want to do with it.

There are a few main categories of ThinkPads. Most people draw a line between old and modern ThinkPads between the ThinkPad T480 and T490, but that is a very superficial way of dividing new and old, as all ThinkPad generations have some differences and there actually exists multiple groups of ThinkPads with similar enough design features that they share parts and speed.

The display size also obviously matters a lot, as it is a window into your computer. Not only that, it determines which mods you can do to your ThinkPad, and possibly the CPU generation that it bears.

Therefore, you have a few general choices in terms of era, which are (conveniently) laid out in the following diagram:
