## Long time no see!

Sorry for not posting so much. My workloads been very very heavy; working on projects like this one. IGCSE CS students, look out for the comprehensive whole-syllabus comp sci revision guide soon! I will release it before mocks.

## What is this workbook?

I wrote it because my comp sci teacher let me volunteer to teach. I happily took the offer due to everybody's cluelessness (they still cannot assign variables). So far I taught 2d arrays in front of the class, and technically this is an assignment only I was set; to make a worksheet on iteration and arrays. It is now a workbook as people need explanations.
