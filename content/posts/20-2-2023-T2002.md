## The introduction
Hello, and welcome to the very first devlog of whow. As you may or may not know, I am writing a very minimal "life organizer" app, which is basically a calendar app that focuses on everything but the calendar part. I have already wrote a blog post about that (find it [here!](/posts/4-2-2023-t0850)). Like any good developer, he/she/insert-hipster-asf-pronoun-here should write some devlogs, and this is what I am doing, because I have no life, and this will serve as documentation when I get to that part.

Like any good project out there in all creative fields, there should be a to-do list, or a planned feature list, and of course [whow has one](https://github.com/ezntek/whow#planned-features-high-priority). One of the most important features that was left out of v0.1 was the schedule, which was prominently present in the old version, **serving no purpose to anyone.**

 > Wait but you forgot about me!

[shut up, **cikitta**. you just have no brain. (1)](#appendix) I mean, who can't remember basic things such as when to shower during the day, that really is a bit overreliant on technology, right?

Let me rephrase, **ALMOST** anyone. Happy now?

 > üñï

Of course.

So because ~~because I'm a simp for cikitta~~ I'm a dumbass perfectionist, I just had to include it. I mean, if I were to re-implement it, I would do it well, right?

***right?***

Now to the data structures part.

Looking at the old implementation of this, it would've looked something like this (taken from the [github repo](https://github.com/daringcuteseal/whow)):
```
sched sun "08:00 AM" "09:00 AM" "Learn animation" @blender
sched ev "09:10 AM" "10:00 AM" "Illustrate" @illustration
sched we "01:00 PM" "03:00 PM" "Continue current project"
```
Now that is NOT readable at all, right?

> HEY LISTEN UP YOU LITTLE DUMB ASSHOLE

okay okay, it kind of is readable, but the fact that these are shortened terms and positional arguments only makes this very unreadable. You have to have actually used this before to know what most of the syntax is, like the category syntax or the day-of-week annotation syntax. Now, a beter solution would be to use JSON, maybe something like this:

```json
{
    "thu": [
        {
            "name": "Do Homework",
            "begin": "4:00 PM",
            // there is no end
            "categories": [
                "pain",
                "work"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "sun": [
        {
            "name": "Learn Animation",
            "begin": "8:00 AM",
            "end": "9:00 AM",
            "categories": [
                "blender"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Illustrate",
            "begin": "9:10 AM",
            "end": "10:00 AM",
            "categories": [
                "illustration"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

And that was a serious consideration when I wanted to revamp the schedule implementation. However, some issues rose, which included:
1. The need to change the schedule all the time, because we (as humans) are not that dumb to be robots, *yet*.
1. Asshole syntax: would you like to read `sched ev "9:00 AM" "10:10 AM" "kepo bangat" @your @mother @is @gay` or `{"thu": [{"name": "Do Homework","begin": "4:00 PM","categories": ["pain","work"]}],"sun": [{"name": "Learn Animation","begin": "8:00 AM","end": "9:00 AM","categories": ["blender"]},{"name": "Illustrate","begin": "9:10 AM","end": "10:00 AM","categories": ["illustration"]}]}`?
1. ~~A general hate for unformatted serialized text~~
1. ~~I just had to re-invent the wheeel because I have no life~~

So I went out to re-invent the wheel, by totally reimplementing how the schedule works, making it slightly less usable, and making it very much need a rewrite later on to fix the issues that the new implementation brought about.

## The new implementation (showcase)
Introducing, the new implementation!

```toml
[schedule]
    anchor_date = 2023-02-06 # anchors which week this is referring to  
    
    repeats = [
        "mon",
        "thu",
        "sun"
    ]
    
    [schedule.days]
        # The schedule for monday
        [[schedule.days.mon]]
            begin = 09:00:00
            end = 10:00:00 # can be an empty string
            label = "my dumb label"
            categories = ["school"]
        [[schedule.days.mon]]
            begin = 09:30:00
            end = ""
            label = "foo bar"
            categories = ["random"]
        
        [[schedule.days.thu]]
            begin = 13:25:00
            end = 14:30:30
            label = "baz"
            categories = ["random", "programming"]

        [[schedule.days.sun]]
            begin = 08:50:00
            end = 09:20:00
            label = "spam"
            categories = ["cooking"]
```

(please excuse this dumb syntax highlighting, toml 100% has support for dates and time.)

What did I change in this implementation?
 * **how it works**: now, a schedule is (and can be) anchored to a week, to help with rendering and structuring. One file only represents a week's worth of content. Leaving it empty will mean that the schedule loops forever (to keep it true to the original!).
 * The format: toml. JSON may be a bit too long and verbose. Yes, YAML was put into serious consideration, as everyone is saying that yaml is better than toml, but after actually using yaml in a few places, I decided that it was too verbose anyway, the syntax is slightly strange, and the indentation rules were too dumb.
 * The entire backend: read on to find out.

Now for the juicy part, the implementation.

## *The implementation.*

### preface
Firstly, programmers don't like confusing syntax, especially for data serialization. Toml has some weird syntax rules when it comes to a list of tables. Basically this is a table in TOML (a set of KV pairs):

```toml
[person]
name = "cikitta"
gender = "female"
age = "13"
is_a_dumbass = false
```

The JSON equivalent would be
```json
{
    "person": {
        "name": "cikitta",
        "gender": "female",
        "age": 13,
        "isADumbass": false
    }
}
```

Now, say you are in a situation where you have a (small) digital phone book. Let's suppose that one of the entries would look like
```json
{
    "person": {
        "name": "bob",
        "phoneNumber": "1234 5678"
    }
}
```

Logically, the next thing you would do is to make a list with the name "phoneBook" at the root of the tree, and a list of people in the phoneBook list,  like this:
```json
{
    "phoneBook": [
        {
            "name": "timmy",
            "phoneNumber": "1800-I-FAILURE"
        },
        {
            "name": "bob",
            "phoneNumber": "1234 9876"
        }
    ]
}
```
The na√Øve toml answer to that would be
```toml
phone_book = [
    {name = "timmy", phone_number = "1800-I-FAILURE"},
    {name = "bob", phone_number = "1234 9876"}
]
```
And that won't be wrong, it can get really unreadable if single line tables are continuously used.
Trying to do this would be invalid:
```toml
phone_book = [
    {
        name = "timmy",
        phone_number = "1800-I-FAILURE"
    },
    {
        name = "bob",
        phone_number = "1234 9876"
    }
]
```
because that would be not far off from JSON, and

```toml
phone_book = [
    []
    name = "timmy"
    phone_number = "1800-I-FAILURE"

    []
    name = "bob"
    phone_number = "1234 9876"
]
```

Would just look and be wrong.

Now, the syntax for `toml` for that would be actually
```toml
[[phone_book]]
name = "timmy"
phone_number = "1800-I-FAILURE"

[[phone_book]]
name = "bob"
phone_number = "1234 9876"
```

Notice the double square brackets? yes, that is how you would write a list of tables, where the list would be called "phone_book".

Back to the syntax rules, JSON would still be undoubtably king, but looking at the cleanliness of TOML, second thoughts definitely come. This is why I chose TOML and not json/yaml for this. The rest of the devlog will be using toml, with some json representations if things get too complex.

### initial steps to serialization

trying to serialize the above sample schedule would result in this python dictionary:

```py
{
    "schedule": {
        "anchor_date" : datetime.date(2023, 2, 6),
        "repeats": [
            "mon", 
            "thu",
            "sun"
        ],

        "days": {
            "mon": [
                {
                    "begin": datetime.time(9, 0, 0),
                    "end": datetime.time(10, 0, 0),
                    "label": "my dumb label",
                    "categories": [
                        "school"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "begin": datetime.time(9, 30, 0),
                    "end": None,
                    "label": "foo bar",
                    "categories": [
                        "random"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "thu": [
                {
                    "begin": datetime.time(13, 25, 0),
                    "end": datetime.time(14, 30, 30),
                    "label": "baz",
                    "categories": [
                        "random", 
                        "programming"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "sun": [
                {
                    "begin": datetime.time(8, 50, 0),
                    "end": datetime.time(9, 20, 0),
                    "label": "spam",
                    "categories": [
                        "cooking"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Somewhat wreadable, right? ***only 6 nested layers, right?*** But that isn't important, we have to get a better representation of the entire schedule dictoinary tree, maybe as a python dataclass. This devlog may actually serve as a great tutorial, so you can watch on if you are trying to code data structures, in python or in any language.

First, we have to isolate the smallest part of the schedule tree, probably the dictionary within the list of the day. I called this a schedule entry, and a class representation of this would be something like

```py
@dataclass
class ScheduleEntry():
    begin: datetime.time
    end: typing.Union[datetime.time, None] # union types because I have to keep it compatible with the latest PyPy implementation (3.9 right now)
    label: str
    categories: list[str]
```

Here's an implementation in golang: (im not good at this dont roast please)
```go
type ScheduleEntry struct {
    begin time.Time
    end interface{ time.Time | nil }
    label string
    categories []str
}
```

Now, because we already have a class for a category (defined earlier in thne source file), we can swap out the `str` part:

```py
@dataclass
class Category():
    name: str
    color: str = "" # colorama color
```

```go
type Category struct {
    Name string
    Color color.Color
}
```

```py
@dataclass
class ScheduleEntry():
    begin: datetime.time
    end: typing.Union[datetime.time, None]
    label: str
    categories: list[Category]
```

```go
type ScheduleEntry struct {
    Begin time.Time
    End interface{ time.Time | nil }
    Label string
    Categories []Category
}
```

so now the tree would look something like this:

```py
{
    "schedule": {
        "anchor_date" : datetime.date(2023, 2, 6),
        "repeats": [
            "mon", 
            "thu",
            "sun"
        ],
        "days": {
            "mon": [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 0, 0), datetime.time(10, 0, 0), "my dumb label", [Category("school")]),
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 30, 0), None, "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]),
            ],
            "thu": [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(13, 25, 0), datetime.time(14, 30, 30), "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]
            ],
            "sun": [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(8, 50, 0), datetime.time(9, 20, 0), "spam", [Category("cooking")])
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Next, it'd probably be a good idea to represent the entire day of week as a class, like this:

```py
@dataclass
class ScheduleDay():
    day_of_week: str
    entries: list[ScheduleEntry]
    repeat: bool
```

```go
type ScheduleDay struct {
    DayOfWeek string
    Entries []ScheduleEntry
    Repeat bool
}
```

```py
{
    "schedule": {
        "anchor_date" : datetime.date(2023, 2, 6),
        "repeats": [
            "mon", 
            "thu",
            "sun"
        ],
        "days": [
            ScheduleDay("mon", [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 0, 0), datetime.time(10, 0, 0), "my dumb label", [Category("school")]),
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 30, 0), None, "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]),
            ], True),
            ScheduleDay("thu", [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(13, 25, 0), datetime.time(14, 30, 30), "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]
            ], True),
            ScheduleDay("sun", [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(8, 50, 0), datetime.time(9, 20, 0), "spam", [Category("cooking")])
            ], True)
        ]
    }
}
```

We could also get rid of the `repeats` list, because the Scehdule Day objects can now hold repitition data themselves:

```py
{
    "schedule": {
        "anchor_date" : datetime.date(2023, 2, 6),
        
        "days": [
            ScheduleDay("mon", [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 0, 0), datetime.time(10, 0, 0), "my dumb label", [Category("school")]),
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 30, 0), None, "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]),
            ], True),
            ScheduleDay("thu", [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(13, 25, 0), datetime.time(14, 30, 30), "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]
            ], True),
            ScheduleDay("sun", [
                ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(8, 50, 0), datetime.time(9, 20, 0), "spam", [Category("cooking")])
            ], True)
        ]
    }
}
```

Now, we simplified every complex dictionary into an object, completing the first step of many in order to be able to serialize and deserialize this schedule tree. The next step would be to add types to as many things as we can, and because this devlog is getting way too long, I'll end this here. 

I hope you all enjoyed this very long devlog, another one is coming! Stay tuned.
