# Preface

This is quite closely tied for my MYP Personal Project and may be submitted as a part of my product.

# Introduction

A lot of money was wasted on this. The PP and both ThinkPads; well over 300SGD if I am counting correctly. Was it worth it? kinda? I may be able to sell the i5 X230 for quite some money. This story, a tale, involves a lot of stupid fuck-ups that REALLY should NOT have happened, but oh well. Bricked motherboards, the constant fear of the backlight fuse being blown, BIOS flashing, and the death of 2 OFFICIAL (used) classic keyboards.

## Context

The IB MYP Personal Project is used as the exit to the IB Middle Years Program (MYP) in my school. It involves creating a product and using all the MYP report-writing skills gathered over the past 5 years through middle school and the first 2 years of high school to write a report about a learning goal, a product goal, the creation of the product and how the goals were reached and to what extent. The product **is not** graded, only the report.

## How it started

A while back, I had two choices for a product. 

 * **Option One**: Finish beanmaths. Yes, [beanmaths](https://github.com/BeanwareHQ/beanmaths), the rapid-fire multiplayer fast-paced mental math practice game. It would have been really fun to do and it would have been a fun _programming_ project that would have benefitted me in the future, but it would be a monumental effort to complete, and I decided that I wanted a summer holiday.
 * **Option Two**: Upgrade/restore ThinkPads. I already bought a ThinkPad T480, but I really could not stand how bad my MacBook was, so i just upgraded it before the PP even started, all in one night, in around 1 and a half hours. Oh well. Thing is, I stumbled across the Ivy Bridge ThinkPads and Sandy Bridge ThinkPads one day, and I was fascinated about how upgradable they were, the fact that their **CPUs were socketed**, and the fabled LVDS board and classic keyboard mod for true ultimacy. As I wanted to daily drive an Ivy Bridge ThinkPad, as it was corebootable, of course I would go with this option. It would cost a lot, but *what* could POSSIBLY go wrong?

## Famous last words

I decided that it would be a good idea to burn some _cold, hard cash_. I looked on Carousell (goodwill, basically) for countless hours for a T430 that was affordable enough to purchase for the PP, and I stumbled upon JK InfoTech. His ThinkPads on th elisting costed anywhere between S$149 and S$199, and I thought that was a lot, till I asked him if he had any _broken_ ones. I went to his shop to ask, and he pulled out a T430, for a whopping...

***35 SINGAPORE DOLLARS***.

A fully working ThinkPad (with a line on the display) without a Hard Drive and Battery, for 35 dollars. It was too good a deal that I just had to go back later.

I then went on a haul, to purchase 2 laptops each with a classic keyboard. A ThinkPad T420, a T410 and I also impulse-purchased an X230, _just for the fun as I then thought_. All laptops were advertised as not working, except the X230, which just had no battery and hard drive (it even had 8GB of RAM!). However, as I'd find out, Mr. JK InfoTech would be very wrong...

All that costed me 105 dollars, for all 3 laptops. That already brings my spendings to 140 Singapore Dollars. By this point, it was already around the 17th of April, where stuff related to the Personal Project already began

## The first major mistake

Fast forward to May the 4th. It was a calm and normal day, and I had begun upgrading the T430 early to satisfy my cravings of an Ivy Bridge ThinkPad. I had all my parts ready, which included:

 * an Intel Core i7-3840QM (the fastest quad core chip I can put into the T430 without overheating)
 * 16 Gigabytes of LPDDR3-1600 RAM (2x8)
 * An Innolux N140HCE-EN1 and LVDS to eDP board
 * An Alps classic keyboard
 * A dGPU heatsink with a delta fan
 * An MPE-AX3000H (miniPCI AX210, basically)
 * a 960GB Kingston SSD

The upgrades soon commenced with great successes. The new processor seemed to work just fine, along with the RAM. The classic keyboard fit into the palmrest just fine after some filing ot the tabs, and the SSD was also detected.

However, when I attemped to upgrade the display, disaster struck.

***the AC cable was plugged into the computer.***

I did not notice at the time, but the realization only hit me when I undid all my upgrades. I fried my T430 motherboard.

At first I blamed it on the LVDS board. I went onto reddit and asked the T430 expert `u/Anomaly02` (if I remember correctly) for some advice. He said that the LVDS board is a fake one, and that people have reported damaged computers from faulty LVDS boards. I used that as my scapegoat as I mourned the death of the computer that I wanted to see work the most.

## Some more purchases

The next time around, before I could have gotten to upgrading the T420 and X230 for some more upgrades, I really wanted a working T430, so I just decided to get another one.

(insert image)

I got that one from Taobao instead for a low price of 99 Singapore dollars properly refurbished, and I received it in a...questionable state.

The seller completely nuked the rubberized coating to reveal a cheap plastic finish on the lid, while the sides of the lid were still sticky and gummy. The inside of the laptop housed a Core i5-3210M with 4 Gigabytes of DDR3 RAM and a 120GB SSD from an unheard of Chinese brand (insert image), and a JIS keyboard that was relatively well refurbished. It booted up just fine, to a version of Microsoft Windows 10 with a lot of preinstalled Chinese apps.

## The second big mistake

That very same night, I took all the parts I could salvage from the other T430 and a few more new ones (such as an i7-3632QM that would suck much less power, giving one a much better battery life).

However, the same thing happened, I ended up with a T430 with a fried display. This time I was extra careful to leave everything disconnected. The LVDS board even worked after I plugged in my N140HCE-EN1, yet the display was fried when I plugged in my B140HAK01.0, which was actually the cause (more details later). I wasted another brand new classic keyboard, a Chicony in extremely good condition, and another 100 dollars worth of parts. Oh well. This time however, I was truly clueless as to what went wrong (yet I would still soon find out.)

## Oh, yet another big mistake!
