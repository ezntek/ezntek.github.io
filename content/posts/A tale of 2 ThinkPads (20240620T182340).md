# Preface

This is quite closely tied for my MYP Personal Project and may be submitted as a part of my product.

# Introduction

A lot of money was wasted on this. The PP and both ThinkPads; well over 300SGD if I am counting correctly. Was it worth it? kinda? I may be able to sell the i5 X230 for quite some money. This story, a tale, involves a lot of stupid fuck-ups that REALLY should NOT have happened, but oh well. Bricked motherboards, the constant fear of the backlight fuse being blown, BIOS flashing, and the death of 2 OFFICIAL (used) classic keyboards.

## Context

The IB MYP Personal Project is used as the exit to the IB Middle Years Program (MYP) in my school. It involves creating a product and using all the MYP report-writing skills gathered over the past 5 years through middle school and the first 2 years of high school to write a report about a learning goal, a product goal, the creation of the product and how the goals were reached and to what extent. The product **is not** graded, only the report.

## How it started

A while back, I had two choices for a product. 

 * **Option One**: Finish beanmaths. Yes, [beanmaths](https://github.com/BeanwareHQ/beanmaths), the rapid-fire multiplayer fast-paced mental math practice game. It would have been really fun to do and it would have been a fun _programming_ project that would have benefitted me in the future, but it would be a monumental effort to complete, and I decided that I wanted a summer holiday.
 * **Option Two**: Upgrade/restore ThinkPads. I already bought a ThinkPad T480, but I really could not stand how bad my MacBook was, so i just upgraded it before the PP even started, all in one night, in around 1 and a half hours. Oh well. Thing is, I stumbled across the Ivy Bridge ThinkPads and Sandy Bridge ThinkPads one day, and I was fascinated about how upgradable they were, the fact that their **CPUs were socketed**, and the fabled LVDS board and classic keyboard mod for true ultimacy. As I wanted to daily drive an Ivy Bridge ThinkPad, as it was corebootable, of course I would go with this option. It would cost a lot, but *what* could POSSIBLY go wrong?

## Famous last words

I decided that it would be a good idea to burn some _cold, hard cash_. I looked on Carousell (goodwill, basically) for countless hours for a T430 that was affordable enough to purchase for the PP, and I stumbled upon JK InfoTech. His ThinkPads on th elisting costed anywhere between S$149 and S$199, and I thought that was a lot, till I asked him if he had any _broken_ ones. I went to his shop to ask, and he pulled out a T430, for a whopping...

***35 SINGAPORE DOLLARS***.

A fully working ThinkPad (with a line on the display) without a Hard Drive and Battery, for 35 dollars. It was too good a deal that I went back.
