## Finally??

Yes, this is a little bit delayed, but 3 days before the final computer science paper 1, I'm releasing this guide to help you all study.

![cover page](/img/finalcsrgcover.png)

## What is this?

This is essentially a bank of notes for IGCSE computer science, the theory part. I will chop up my CSRG G2 semester 1 guide, which has extensive coverage of logic gates and programming, and release it independently, later. These notes are very, very detailed, so it is also a guide to some extent.

For more info, read the Information section at the front of the guide.

## DOWNLOAD

* [Revision 5 (May 13, 2025)](/doc/CSRG_Full_Rev5.pdf)

Alternatively, [view the source code on Github](https://github.com/ezntek/CSRG).

## CHANGELOG

* **Revision 2**: Added Cloud Storage, fix spelling mistakes, improve wording across chapter 2.
* **Revision 3**: Add IPv6, fix minor errors in the intro, improve wording in chapter 5.
* **Revision 4**: Fix RAM access time, add ISBN-13/Modulo 11 syllabus omission notices, add SSL in chapter 5.
* **Revision 5**: Fix spelling errors, formatting errors, add note about possible inclusion of errors.

## ERRATA

This details the **factual, content-based errors** that I may have made.[^1]

* (fixed in **revision 4**): SRAM/DRAM access time is in **nanoseconds, not milliseconds** (pages 38, 39)
* (fixed in **revision 5**): DRAM consumes less power (page 39) and not SRAM, the program counter holds the **next instruction** (page 50)
