## Finally??

Yes, this is a little bit delayed, but 3 days before the final computer science paper 1, I'm releasing this guide to help you all study.

## What is this?

This is essentially a bank of notes for IGCSE computer science, the theory part. I will chop up my CSRG G2 semester 1 guide, which has extensive coverage of logic gates and programming, and release it independently, later. These notes are very, very detailed, so it is also a guide to some extent.

For more info, read the Information section at the front of the guide.
