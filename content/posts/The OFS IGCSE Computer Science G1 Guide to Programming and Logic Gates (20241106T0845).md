* [The OFS IGCSE Computer Science G1 Guide to Programming and Logic Gates, Revision Three](https://ezntek.com/doc/CSRG_G1_Rev3.pdf)

## What is this?

![Cover](/img/csrgg1cover.png)

I have already released [this](https://ezntek.com/posts/the-ofs-igcse-computer-science-g2-exam-revision-reference-guide-20241105t2152/) guide for the G2 students, and since your examination has so much overlap with mine, I have abridged my guide to make it so that you can use some content for your exam as well.

This guide covers:

* The programming stuff
* The logic gate stuff

***This guide doesn't cover:***

* Systems lifecycle stuff
* The binary and data representation stuff

I don't have time to write anything extra for you, **please remember to use your own notes too!** I am not liable.
