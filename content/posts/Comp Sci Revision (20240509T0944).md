## For the uneducated:

Our school provides the IGCSE Comp Sci 0478 course (instead of ICT now), but the school's selection of
teachers are *suboptimal*. Despite their best efforts to teach us as much as they can, computer science
is a hard subject for many and they may need a revision guide to help them.
