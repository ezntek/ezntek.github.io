## After much anticipation...

It is finally ready, ***yes, the new CSRG***!

The *TRUE* Sequel to the previous one (you can find it [here](/posts/comp-sci-revision-20240509t0944)), where I wrote a ~40 page reference to all the topics that would be covered in the upcoming exam.

However, that only did so much; this semester we are being tested on a crap ton of stuff:

* Emerging Technologies [^1]
  * Expert Systems and machine learning and stuff
  * Automated systems and stuff
  * robots and stuff
* Logic gates
  * lotsa lotsa gates
  * lotsa lotsa diagrams
  * lotsa lotsa truth tables
  * lotsa lotsa expressions and stuff
* ***programming***
* some other stuff i think

..which is why the new **75 page guide** aims to address all these topics. Read the PDF for more information!

[^1]: Check out [this](/posts/dont-write-comments-write-better-code-20241105t2141) article for more info as to why I hate the IGCSE examiners so much. Of course they have to have a unit on emerging technologies; it is completely useless and bull...crap!
