# where am I #2

sorry guys, i always forget to post on my blog because

1. noone reads it anyway
2. i gotta deal with life

so yeah. I gave up on the FreeBSD blog, because i hopped from FreeBSD back to void, then to gentoo, then to NixOS, where I am now. im still working hard on [smbuilder](https://github.com/ezntek/smbuilder) and a new project called smbuilder-configurator, as smbuilder is now a cli-only tool, and the GUI configurator will be a seperate web app that is run locally.
