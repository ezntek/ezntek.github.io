# Where the hell am I?

I am alive. I'm not dead. I had this thing called [school](https://ofs.edu.sg) to worry about, so I couldn't work on anything. To anyone who cares enough to read this dumb blog, my apologies. My easter break is ending, so development of everything must be paused, but I have a work-in-progress blog post, so just you all wait.

# Where is whow?

[dead.](https://github.com/ezntek/whow)

The codebase was too messy, and I did not see a reason to continue developing it for now. I am envisioning a libadwaita+pygobject rewrite, but not right now. I have to work on [smbuilder](https://github.com/ezntek/smbuilder).
