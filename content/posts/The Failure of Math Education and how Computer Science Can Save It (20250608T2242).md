## Intro

> and elegant solutions.

Are some words I shared in a speech I delivered to my high school, one that I made with a few of my great friends.

In a world of formulas and rules spoonfed to people, where calculating the volume of a cone is more of a chore, or where solving quadratics is seen as the pinnacle of your math skills, we must stop and think, are we really doing this right?

## What is math?

I'm drafting this blog post quite late into the night. For me, I sleep around this time. I stumbled upon [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSFA1Fp8jcU) video that showed some really interesting logical problems; stuff in discrete mathematics that no math student would ever see in their education, because all they do is solve quadratics.

It really is quite traumatic for many people. When they hear math, they don't think of a subject of problem-solving and rigorous logic. They think that it's a subject where formulas reign, where you just crunch numbers all the time; almost like how the entirety of the subject of math is centered around numbers. It really isn't.

Take lambda calculus for example; all you're dealing with are functions that transform values into different values. And with no numbers involved, just a silly little lambdas that take an input in and produce some variation of it. You can **create "numbers" from the ground up**, and do complex computations with not a single number at its core.

Or maybe graph theory; there can be numbers, but are there really numbers? You could easily represent...your whole high school friend group[^1] could just be represented with a weighted graph, and most of it isn't numbers. That's how realistic it *could* get.

But quoting a great teacher[^2], she said, roughly,

> When I was at school, I was taught that math was just about formulas. When you see this use this formula.
> When you see that use that formula. It was more of a way to judge your worth, more like torture.

which sums up what people think of math to be. It's less about all the thinking you could do; like using pure logic to deduct proofs that always hold true (TODO: quote from that one guy about theorems and conjectures), but more about how people use it to judge you. In asia, getting good grades in math definitively means you are automatigically smart, and the like; yet in math class, you don't even use any "real math" skills, you're just told to undersand these particular formulas, without knowing why they work.

This is wrong. Math is about logic, about problem-solving, and applying mathematical techniques in the real world can get you to very very unexpected places. Places that seemingly don't involve numbers at all. TODO: Line blur between discrete math and other subjects

## Wrapping up

[^1]: I'm still a teenager at heart. I care a bunch about people, I overthink about my relationships with people, even; crazy pseudomathematician ezntek would definitely have these thoughts.
[^2]: From popular opinion in my school (Ms. Wee), she came up to the computer lab where I spend most of my time at school, saw me do a bunch of basic math on the board (cubic factoring).
