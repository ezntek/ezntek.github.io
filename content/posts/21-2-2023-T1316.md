## Introduction

When I first started working on whow, I had one problem that'd never go away, dictionary type annotations. Take the To-do dictionary type annotation for example:

```py
dict[str, typing.Union[str, int, bool, list[str]]]
```

The data structure isn't even that complex, and the type annotation is already pretty long. Additionally, if I were to try to index this dictionary if this was (let's say) freshly deserialized from a toml file, pyright wouldn't pick the keys that exist up at all. Instead, it'd just throw an error complaining that the type is unknown.

```py
import tomllib

toml_string: str = """
[name_of_todo]
    index = 0
    name = "name_of_todo"
    due = 4206-09-01
    categories = [
        "categoryName1",
        "categoryName2"
    ]
    overdue = false
"""

d = tomllib.loads(toml_string)
my_string: str = dict["name_of_todo"]["name"]   # Expression of type "Type[dict[Unknown, Unknown]]" cannot be assigned to declared type "str"
                                                # "Type[type]" is incompatible with "Type[str]"
                                                # Pylance (reportGeneralTypeIssues)
```

and to fix that I would've had to put `# type: ignore`, but then that ruins the purpose of a type checker.

Being the nerd that I am, I read PEPs, Python Enchancement Proposals, and one day I stumbled upon one on [the pyright github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), [PEP 589](https://peps.python.org/pep-0589), and quoting PEP 589:

 > PEP 484 defines the type Dict[K, V] for uniform dictionaries, where each vlaue has the same type, and arbitrary key values are supported. [However], [i]t doesn't properly support the common pattern where the type of a dictionary value depends on the string value of the key.
 > This PEP proposes a type constructor `typing.TypedDict` to support the use case where a dictionary has a specific set of string keys, each with a balue of a specific type.

Woah, what? the advantages of a dataclass but in a dict?!

***I was down***.

Looking at the examples blew me away even more:

```py
import typing

class Movie(typing.TypedDict):
    name: str
    year: int
```

```py
movie: Movie = {'name': 'Blade Runner',
                'year': 1982}
```

And I just HAD TO fix my dictionary mess with this. Even better, `TypedDict`s were added in 3.8, so PyPy support wouldn't go away!

## Let's type!

First, I had to find out what I was working with. Looking at all the data structures present at the time, we had:

 * Categories,
 * To-Do Entries,
 * Event Entries,
 * Schedule Entries, and
 * Schedule Days.

All of which would need to be serialized and deserialized during some point in the lifecycle of the app. Let's start with the Category dataclass.

### `Category`

The final dictionary format would look something like this:

```py
{
    "name": "category",
    "color": "red"
}
```

so a typed dictionary for that would look something like this:

```py
class CategoryTypedDict(typing.TypedDict):
    name: str
    color: str
```

Now that we're here, why don't we make a function that returns a TypedDict representation of the category as a method of the class?

```py
@dataclass
class Category():
    name: str
    color: str = ""
    
    def to_dict(self) -> CategoryTypedDict:
        return {
            "name": self.name,
            "color": self.color
        }
```

Now, just rinse and repeat.

## The Schedule

The entire reason why I stumbled across typed dictionaries in the first place was because I was trying to research better ways to add types to python for data structures. So why don't we pay tribute to that dumb feature and continue the previous post?

After performing all the steps to reorganize the data into dataclasses, we would now have to make typed dictionaries for their serialized forms.

Take a `ScheduleEntry` as an example:
```py
@dataclass
class ScheduleEntry():
    begin: datetime.time
    end: typing.Union[datetime.time, None]
    label: str
    categories: list[Category]
```
The serialized form of that would be written as

```py
{
    "begin": datetime.time(9, 0, 0),
    "end": datetime.time(10, 0, 0),
    "label": "my dumb label",
    "categories": [
        "school"
    ]
}
```

so naturally, a typed dictionary for that would look something like this:

```py
class ScheduleEntryTypedDict(typing.TypedDict):
    begin: datetime.time
    end: typing.Union[datetime.time, None]
    label: str
    categories: list[str]
```

Now, time to advance up the tree.

(The `ScheduleDay` object does not need a TypedDict, as there is not much to unify the format of)
```py
"days": {
    "mon": [
        ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 0, 0), datetime.time(10, 0, 0), "my dumb label", [Category("school")]),
        ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(9, 30, 0), None, "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]),
    ],
    "thu": [
        ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(13, 25, 0), datetime.time(14, 30, 30), "baz", [Category("random"), Category("programming")]
    ],
    "sun": [
        ScheduleEntry(datetime.time(8, 50, 0), datetime.time(9, 20, 0), "spam", [Category("cooking")])
    ]
}
```

```py
class ScheduleDaysTypedDict(typing.TypedDict):
    mon: ScheduleDay
    tue: ScheduleDay
    wed: ScheduleDay
    thu: ScheduleDay
    fri: ScheduleDay
    sat: ScheduleDay
    sun: ScheduleDay
```

Because we don't have to put each day of the week into the Schedule, we can put `total=False` like a keyword argument in the set of brackets:

```py
class ScheduleDaysTypedDict(typing.TypedDict, total=False):
    mon: ScheduleDay
    tue: ScheduleDay
    wed: ScheduleDay
    thu: ScheduleDay
    fri: ScheduleDay
    sat: ScheduleDay
    sun: ScheduleDay
```

Now, because we have to be able to take one typed dictionary and be able to serialize it into a common format such as TOML or JSON, we have to make a Typed Dictionary for that above data structure. Because we do not have a typed dictionary for a `ScheduleDay` (reasons stated above), we have to put long dictionary type annotations to keep it pure, like this:

```py
class ScheduleDaysDictTypedDict(typing.TypedDict, total=False):
    mon: list[ScheduleEntryTypedDict] # expands to a dict
    tue: list[ScheduleEntryTypedDict]
    wed: list[ScheduleEntryTypedDict]
    thu: list[ScheduleEntryTypedDict]
    fri: list[ScheduleEntryTypedDict]
    sat: list[ScheduleEntryTypedDict]
    sun: list[ScheduleEntryTypedDict]
```

so now, we can represent the days list as a typed dictionary.

Moving up the tree again, we can now represent the entire schedule tree as a typed dictionary. Because the entire schedule tree is simplified to the point hwere it does not need another class representation of the entrie tree, I didn't make a class for the Schedule, which sacrificed type safety. But now that I know of typed dictionaries, I could just make a typed dictionary for the schedule.

```py
class ScheduleTypedDict(typing.TypedDict):
    anchor_date: datetime.date
    repeats: list[str]
    days: ScheduleDaysTypedDict
```

And because there are 2 representations of the `ScheduleDays` typed dictionary, I would need to make a pure dict version of a `ScheduleTypedDict`, like this:

```py
class ScheduleDictTypedDict(typing.TypedDict):
    anchor_date: datetime.date
    repeats: list[str]
    days: ScheduleDaysDictTypedDict
```

And now, all the data structures in this project are strongly typed, from deserialization.
