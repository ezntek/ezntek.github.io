## What???

Yes, count this as a sequel to my [last epic guide](https://ezntek.com/posts/comp-sci-revision-20240509t0944/), which was for the suffering G1 students under _magic man_'s leadership.

This one is for everyone! a **FULLY SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTED** (manually done with blood sweat and tears!) reference with side-by-side examples of common programming tasks in both Pseudocode and Python. Revision One covers:

 * comments
 * values
 * conditional branching
 * loops
 * procedures
 * functions
 * arrays
 * file handling

and more to come if you nicely ask!

This is ***NOT*** A comprehensive programming guide! Please do not assume that  this will actually teach you how to code in-depth! When exam season rolls around, I will be authoring a programming tutorial and a theory reference guide just like last year.

stay tuned!!!
