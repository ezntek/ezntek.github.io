# Whow

This is my second production-ready app that I built over the course of a couple of weeks with [DaringCuteSeal](https://github.com/daringcuteseal).

In short, this is a CLI To-Do app that will do almost everything you would want/need in a "life organizer". This app was originally just a solo shell script written by the legend herself, Pearl, but I decided that I was gonna hit her up and rewrite this in Python together. After a few procrastination-filled weeks of development, the bring-up was complete. Now, I say bring-up because this is actually kind of not production-ready, this is only an initial bring-up release, all the features from the old version is not complete, this is just to finnish designing an extensible architecture for me to build on top of for this to-do app.

Now, why am I doing this?

I'm not answering it, I don't know why I built this app, maybe for experience, but I don't see a real-life use case for this app,

## yet.

I did just say that this app is techincally not ready for everyone to use, because the internal API I'm using is so badly structured that I'd be ashamed of it, and laso because the features are a bit lacking. I did not implement many of the features from the older version, biggest of which would be the schedule feature, and repeating schedules. The API is not really that badly structured, its just messy in terms of how I factored this code, so this would need some dire refactoring.

Currently, whow supports:
 * To-Dos (obviously)
 * Events (without repitition)
 * A Calendar (useless at the moment)

And that's really about it. Yeah, pathetic and an overkill [codebase](https://github.com/ezntek/whow) to go with that, but don't underestimate it. Many features are planned down the road, see the GitHub page for more information on that. For now, I'm taking a break from this app, it was really tiring to work on. You can see the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/ezntek/whow).

# Installation (please DON'T)

Pre-requisites: `python3.10` and above, `colorama`, and `toml`.
 1. Get the source code. Distribution was not put in mind for this release.
 2. Copy the `whow` directory within the directory to somewhere hidden, like `$HOME/.whow`.
 3. Write a shell script that calls your python interpreter and then that folder, something like
 ```sh
 #!/bin/sh

 /path/to/python3 $HOME/.whow $@
 ```

# Roasting Pearl's blog post (so fun, it's satire, chill)

> Wow, Whow. That little script with a weird name (this guy said that) that I wrote as a joke and satire but useful app.

Who the f*ck would name something whow? is the H silent or do you pronounce it at the back of your mouth? I do the latter, just to piss you off, **Cikitta.**

> Yeah, I remember that afternoon. I was sitting cozily on my chair attending the computer extracurricular when I got pissed off because we had to use Trello and not write a to-do app instead

This is how all projects start, for me, I remember that morning when I found DaringCuteSeal, we started talking, then we started this rewrite, because I think shell is a bit old for scripting.

>  And yes, I only wrote like 5% of the app, Iâ€™m trying to grasp anything other than shell right now.

Stop being so humble, idiot. You are the person who started this nightmarish thing. A more accurate number would be 25%. Yeah, I do code faster.

> I never really bothered to learn Python this much because shell scripting exists

Excuse me?

> Whow is now a 1340-lined ultra messy bash script.
