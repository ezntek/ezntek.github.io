## So...

![The earbuds](/img/earbuds.jpg)

These earbuds are kinda meh. TL;DR: the mids are strong, the high end is muddy, the case feels kinda cheap but are actually decent for the price.

## The good

 * These are cheap. Despite how the label says S$79, these actually only costed S$65, which are actually a steal.
 * These are Sony earbuds, so you do get the Sony software and support, with all the EQ magic they have.
 * The noise cancellation is **insanely good**. Even without active noise cancellation, the ear tips themselves do absolute magic on any surrounding noise, whether if its wind from a fan, the air conditioner, or whatever else. Having used AirPods Pro gen 1's previously, I must say that these are 95-98% the strength, without all the head pain from the noise ANC generates.
 * The mids are great. If you listen to genres like [ChillSynth](https://chillsynth.com)[^1] these are perfect.

## The bad

 * The case feels cheap.
 * The earbuds also feels cheap.
 * There is no ANC, which may annoy some.
 * The case does not actually have any magnets, making opening and closing feel much cheaper.

## The ugly
 
 * The trebles are **very very muddy**, if you have ever used better headphones you will know what I'm talking about. Say goodbye to vocal clarity, they will be slightly muddy. The EQ only somewhat fixes it.
 * The drivers are only 6mm. Coming from my Pixel Buds A-series', it is a massive, massive downgrade.
 * The sound isn't particularly "room filling" nor "full", it's just sound.

## Verdict

This was just a quick review, I'm not in the mood of writing anything exciting. **Avoid these** if you have money, I tried to not burn my wallet this time around but man if I just splurged a bit more, would I have gotten much better sound. If these are the only budget option available, these are not bad, but coming from better audio devices, these aren't the best.

These are 90-95% as good as AirPods Pro 1's for EDM (complextro/electro house/bass house/future bass/future bass), Hardstyle sounds fine on these (not painful enough), and ChillSynth sounds pretty damn good (no it sounds *awesome*). I would still rather my Pixel Buds A-series, but oh well.

If you are looking for similarly priced earbuds in asia, look to [**sudio**](https://sudio.com), I've heard great things about them, and products similarly priced to these sonies (At least here) have at least bigger drivers, ANC, and a longer battery life.
