## ezntek, you broke a promise?

Yes! i said that would finish a full syllabus revision guide for all the chapters and for all the content covered, but I was not motivated to finish it all, below is a link to an incomplete coverless version with a bunch of inconsistencies, mid explanations and typos, but it surely is better than nothing.

Find it [here](https://ezntek.com/doc/csrg_incomplete.pdf)
