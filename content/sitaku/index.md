# Sitaku

[Sitaku](https://sitaku.miraheze.org) is a minecraft server I play on (a lot).

...It is not really a minecraft server in the classic sense. Instead, it is more like a
collection of minecraft worlds with a community overlaid on top of it. Sitaku always will have a 
survival and creative world active, and map resets are done whenever they are necessary.

The current maps that we play on (active) are 9s (the ninth survival) and 2c (the second creative).
I am most active on 2c (because it is objectively better).

## What do I do?

Rails.

A lot of this is under construction, especially the heavy rail. But that is my job. I drew the
map and planned the rail network, and it is my job, along with my friend [Kasreti](https://kasreti.github.io) to build.

The capital region railway (the Sitaku City metro) is the dense area with station bubbles, and station distances ar
anywhere from 500 to 800 blocks.

Anything without station bubbles are out-of-capital, meaning that those are _heavy rail_ stations. This means that they
can span much longer distances, the shortest distance between stations on the network being about 1750 blocks (I think).

I also do graphic design; I draw all the maps and station art for the subway stations, with the exemption of heavy rail, which
Kasreti does.
