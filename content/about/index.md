# About Me

![Image of Me](/img/face.jpg)

Hey, I'm Eason, otherwise known as eggman, eggy, eason(tech/tek)reviews, easontek and now, ezntek. I'm a 14-year-old programmer living in Singapore. 

After hopping around for a while, I found myself on gentoo again. I have gentoo on my [M1 Mac](https://github.com/chadmed/asahi-gentoosupport), and on my Main PC (However, I do still use macOS for school quite often, because of the incomplete audio drivers and/or I have to use proprietary software. I primarily code desktop and CLI programs (general utilities), and I am planning to get into frontend web development and/or backend (server) programming.

I have a Google Pixel 6a (bluejay) as my phone, running [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org) with [microG](https://microg.org) installed via root.

I mainly code with this one very close friend of mine nowdays, [DaringCuteSeal / Pearl](https://daringcuteseal.xyz) (she's cool, check her stuff out), and we work on projects together, and she is the person who ~~forced~~ *inspired* me to start this blog.
