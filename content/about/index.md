# About Me

![Image of Me](/img/face.jpg)

Hey, I'm Eason, otherwise known as eggman, eggy, eason(tech/tek)reviews, easontek and now, ezntek. I'm a 14-year-old programmer living in Singapore. I am a proud gentoo (including and not limited to, gnu)/linux user, with 2 machines actively being maintained, and another one with Ubuntu and Arch. I primarily code, getting into web development, and I'd say I'm particularly good at writing desktop utilities, GUI or not. You can also catch me doing sketches and graphic design from time to time.

I mainly code with this one specific person nowdays, [DaringCuteSeal / Pearl](https://daringcuteseal.xyz) (she's cool, check her stuff out), and we work on projects together, and she is the person who ~~forced~~ *inspired* me to start this blog.
