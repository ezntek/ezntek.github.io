## why can't i code a lot?

im a student.

## what do i use
I use NixOS on my workstation and Arch (btw) on my M1 MacBook Pro.
_psst: i do use macOS on my mac a little more, as the [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org) drivers need to mature for a bit._

I have a Google Pixel 6a (bluejay) as my phone, running [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org) with [microG](https://microg.org) installed via root.

## other

I mainly code with this one specific person nowdays, [DaringCuteSeal / Pearl](https://daringcuteseal.xyz) (she's cool, check her stuff out), and we work on projects together, and she is the person who ~~forced~~ *inspired* me to start this blog.
